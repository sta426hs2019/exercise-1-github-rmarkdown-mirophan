## Sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution
```{r log-normal dist}
set.seed(1234)
m <- 1
s <- 0.25
location <- log(m^2 / sqrt(s^2 + m^2))
shape <- sqrt(log(1 + (s^2 / m^2)))
samples <- rlnorm(n=100, location, shape)
```

## Histograms of the samples

```{r}
hist(samples,
     main = "Histogram of samples from log-normal distribution")
```

```{r}
hist(log(samples),
     main = "Histogram of samples from log-normal distribution on a log scale")
```


## Reporting the sample mean and variance
Sample mean: `r mean(samples)`

Sample variance: `r sd(samples)**2`
